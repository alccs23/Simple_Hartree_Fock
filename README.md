# Simple_Hartree_Fock
This package computes restricted closed-shell wavefunctions for molecules using Hartree-Fock theory. It supports the STO-nG basis sets, with options for *n* = 2 to 4. Demonstrations show that as the number of primitive Gaussians increases (i.e., higher *n* in STO-nG), the calculated molecular energies become more accurate, reflecting improved basis set quality.
