Final Energy : -7.665868116507
 Hartrees


PySCF outputs a ground state energy (GSE) of -7.8620238601 Hartrees, which is within the expected range of my own SCF final energy.
This difference likely occurs because their calculations include more comprehensive orbital information, particularly p-orbitals.
